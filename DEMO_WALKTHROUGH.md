## 🚀 **Demo Script**

### **Opening: The Security Data Challenge** *(2-3 minutes)*

> **"Today's cybersecurity teams face an impossible choice: collect all the data you need for security, or stay within budget. Traditional SIEM architectures struggle with the explosive growth of security data from cloud and digital transformation."**

**Key Pain Points to Address:**
- **Data Volume Explosion**: Modern enterprises generate terabytes of security logs daily
- **Retention Limits**: Traditional SIEMs force difficult decisions about what data to keep
- **Cost Constraints**: Per-GB ingestion pricing makes comprehensive monitoring prohibitively expensive
- **Data Silos**: Security data scattered across multiple tools and platforms

> **"Let me show you how Snowflake's unique architecture solves these fundamental challenges."**

### **Section 1: Snowflake as a Security Data Lake** *(5-7 minutes)*

#### **1.1 Architecture Advantage**
*[Navigate to Executive Dashboard]*

> **"Unlike traditional SIEMs, Snowflake's architecture separates compute from storage. This means you can store ALL your security data affordably, starting at just $23/TB/month for compressed data."**

**Key Differentiators to Highlight:**
- **No Ingest Tax**: Pay only for storage and compute you use, not for data ingestion
- **Unlimited Retention**: Keep full-fidelity security logs for years, not months
- **Elastic Scaling**: Scale compute resources up/down instantly for incident response

*[Point to metrics on Executive Dashboard]*
> **"In our demo environment, we're analyzing 8 different data sources spanning 30 days of security telemetry - authentication logs, network traffic, vulnerability scans, GitHub activity, and more. In a traditional SIEM, this comprehensive data collection would be cost-prohibitive."**

#### **1.2 Unified Data Platform**
*[Navigate to different dashboard sections]*

> **"Notice how we're seamlessly analyzing data across multiple security domains in a single platform:"**

- **Identity & Access**: User authentication patterns
- **Network Security**: Traffic analysis and threat detection
