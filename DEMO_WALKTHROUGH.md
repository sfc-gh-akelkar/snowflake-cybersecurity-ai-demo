## 🚀 **Demo Script**

### **Opening: The Security Data Challenge** *(2-3 minutes)*

> **"Today's cybersecurity teams face an impossible choice: collect all the data you need for security, or stay within budget. Traditional SIEM architectures struggle with the explosive growth of security data from cloud and digital transformation."**

**Key Pain Points to Address:**
- **Data Volume Explosion**: Modern enterprises generate terabytes of security logs daily
- **Retention Limits**: Traditional SIEMs force difficult decisions about what data to keep
- **Cost Constraints**: Per-GB ingestion pricing makes comprehensive monitoring prohibitively expensive
- **Data Silos**: Security data scattered across multiple tools and platforms

> **"Let me show you how Snowflake's unique architecture solves these fundamental challenges."**

### **Section 1: Snowflake as a Security Data Lake** *(5-7 minutes)*

#### **1.1 Architecture Advantage**
*[Navigate to Executive Dashboard]*

> **"Unlike traditional SIEMs, Snowflake's architecture separates compute from storage. This means you can store ALL your security data affordably, starting at just $23/TB/month for compressed data."**

**Key Differentiators to Highlight:**
- **No Ingest Tax**: Pay only for storage and compute you use, not for data ingestion
- **Unlimited Retention**: Keep full-fidelity security logs for years, not months
- **Elastic Scaling**: Scale compute resources up/down instantly for incident response

*[Point to metrics on Executive Dashboard]*
> **"In our demo environment, we're analyzing 8 different data sources spanning 30 days of security telemetry - authentication logs, network traffic, vulnerability scans, GitHub activity, and more. In a traditional SIEM, this comprehensive data collection would be cost-prohibitive."**

#### **1.2 Unified Data Platform**
*[Navigate to different dashboard sections]*

> **"Notice how we're seamlessly analyzing data across multiple security domains in a single platform:"**

- **Identity & Access**: User authentication patterns
- **Network Security**: Traffic analysis and threat detection  
- **Vulnerability Management**: CVE prioritization and remediation
- **DevSecOps**: GitHub activity and code security
- **Financial Security**: Fraud detection and transaction monitoring

**Business Value:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: All security data in one platform
- **Faster Investigations**: No need to pivot between multiple tools
- **Better Context**: Rich business data alongside security telemetry

### **Section 2: AI/ML Cybersecurity Use Cases** *(15-20 minutes)*

#### **2.1 Anomaly Detection - The Foundation** *(4-5 minutes)*
*[Navigate to Anomaly Detection section]*

> **"Let's start with anomaly detection - the foundation of modern threat detection. Snowflake provides built-in anomaly detection that you can invoke with simple SQL queries."**

*[Show the anomaly detection dashboard]*

**Key Features to Demonstrate:**
- **Real-time Scoring**: ML models scoring user behavior in real-time
- **Risk Classification**: Automatic categorization (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Correlation with known threat indicators
- **Alert Automation**: Integration with Snowflake Alerts and Tasks

*[Point to specific anomalies]*
> **"Here we see Sarah Chen with a critical risk score. The AI detected multiple anomalous behaviors: unusual login location, off-hours activity, and access to sensitive repositories. In a traditional rule-based system, each of these might be separate alerts. Our ML model combines them into a single, prioritized threat."**

**Business Impact:**
- **Reduced False Positives**: ML models learn normal behavior patterns
- **Faster Detection**: Automated scoring vs. manual investigation
- **Scalable Analysis**: Petabyte-scale anomaly detection with SQL

#### **2.2 Threat Detection and Incident Response** *(3-4 minutes)*
*[Navigate to Threat Prioritization section]*

> **"Traditional security teams are overwhelmed by alerts. Snowflake's AI helps prioritize threats based on impact and context."**

*[Show threat prioritization dashboard]*

**Highlight Advanced Capabilities:**
- **Contextual Scoring**: ML models consider threat intel, asset criticality, user behavior
- **Dynamic Prioritization**: Scores adjust based on changing threat landscape
- **Investigation Acceleration**: Rich context reduces MTTR (Mean Time to Response)

*[Point to P0 Critical incidents]*
> **"Notice how our P0 critical incidents correlate with both high anomaly scores AND threat intelligence matches. This isn't just rule-based detection - it's intelligent threat correlation."**

**Snowflake Differentiator:**
> **"The key difference here is our ability to join security logs with GitHub data and threat intelligence from the Snowflake Marketplace in a single query. Traditional SIEMs require complex integrations and data movement."**

#### **2.3 Vulnerability Prioritization** *(3-4 minutes)*
*[Navigate to Vulnerability Management section]*

> **"Not all vulnerabilities are created equal. Snowflake's AI helps focus your patching efforts where they matter most."**

*[Show vulnerability prioritization dashboard]*

**Key AI/ML Features:**
- **Impact Scoring**: ML models assess real business impact
- **Exploitability Analysis**: Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- **Automated Recommendations**: AI-driven patching priorities

*[Point to "Patch Immediately" recommendations]*
> **"Instead of managing thousands of CVEs manually, our AI identifies the 15 vulnerabilities that need immediate attention. This is the difference between reactive and proactive security."**

**Real-World Value:**
> **"Organizations using Snowflake for vulnerability management report finding vulnerable systems in minutes rather than weeks - all with a single SQL query."**

#### **2.4 Fraud Detection** *(2-3 minutes)*
*[Navigate to Fraud Detection section]*

> **"Financial security is cybersecurity. Snowflake's ML capabilities excel at detecting fraudulent patterns in transaction data."**

*[Show fraud detection metrics and trends]*

**Advanced ML Features:**
- **Behavioral Analytics**: User spending pattern analysis
- **Velocity Checks**: Real-time transaction frequency monitoring
- **Geographic Correlation**: Location-based risk scoring
- **Historical Context**: Machine learning from past fraud patterns

**Business Impact:**
- **Real-time Prevention**: Block fraudulent transactions before completion
- **Reduced False Positives**: ML models understand legitimate customer behavior
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Full transaction history for pattern recognition

#### **2.5 Insider Threat Detection** *(2-3 minutes)*
*[Navigate to Insider Threat Detection section]*

> **"The most dangerous threats often come from inside. Snowflake's AI analyzes user behavior across all security domains to identify potential insider threats."**

*[Show insider threat risk scores]*

**Comprehensive Behavioral Analysis:**
- **Data Access Patterns**: Unusual data download behavior
- **Privilege Escalation**: Changes in access patterns
- **Off-Hours Activity**: Time-based anomaly detection
- **Cross-Domain Correlation**: Behavior patterns across multiple systems

### **Section 3: Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** *(3-4 minutes)*

#### **3.1 Automated Compliance Monitoring**
*[Navigate to Executive Dashboard - Compliance section]*

> **"Snowflake automates the manual tasks involved in GRC, such as evidence gathering and compliance reporting."**

**Use Case Example - CIS Control 16:**
> **"For account monitoring and control, we ingest HR termination data and logical access data. Snowflake Alerts automatically detect when terminated users remain active in systems, triggering Jira tickets and Slack notifications. This measurably improves timely access removal compliance."**

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automated Evidence Collection**: No manual report generation
- **Real-time Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous assessment vs. point-in-time audits
- **Integration with Workflows**: Native connections to Slack, Jira, ServiceNow
