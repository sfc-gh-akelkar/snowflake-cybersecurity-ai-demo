## 🎬 Demo Flow (30-45 minutes)

### Phase 1: The Security Challenge (5 minutes)
**Hook**: *"Let me show you how a modern SOC handles a sophisticated cyber attack using Snowflake..."*

#### Key Messages:
- Traditional SIEMs struggle with cloud-scale data volumes
- Security teams are drowning in alerts and false positives
- Manual threat hunting is too slow for modern attack speeds
- Compliance reporting is labor-intensive and error-prone

*"Snowflake changes this entirely. Let me show you how we detect, investigate, and respond to threats using AI..."*

---

### Phase 2: Use Case Demonstrations (25-30 minutes)

#### 🔍 **Use Case 1: AI-Powered Anomaly Detection (6 minutes)**

**Business Context**: Detect compromised accounts and insider threats

**Demo Steps**:
1. Open Streamlit app → Anomaly Detection tab
2. Show executive metrics dashboard
3. **Highlight**: "250 users analyzed, 2 high-risk anomalies detected in 12 minutes"
4. Navigate to "Active Anomalies" tab
5. **Zoom in** on john.smith anomaly:
   - Login from Beijing at 2:30 AM (unusual location/time)
   - 5,000+ lines of code changed during off-hours
   - Access to sensitive payment repositories
   - Score: 12.0 (threshold: 8.0)

**Key SQL Demo**:
```sql
-- Show built-in anomaly detection
SELECT 
    USERNAME,
    ANOMALY_DETECTION(daily_login_count) OVER (
        PARTITION BY USERNAME 
        ORDER BY login_date 
    ) as anomaly_result
FROM user_activity
WHERE anomaly_result:is_anomaly = TRUE;
```

**Business Impact**: 
- "This would typically take 3-4 hours of manual investigation"
- "AI detected this compromise in 12 minutes with 92% confidence"
- "Prevented potential data breach worth $2.4M"

#### 🎯 **Use Case 2: Threat Detection & Incident Response (6 minutes)**

**Business Context**: Correlate threats across multiple data sources

**Demo Steps**:
1. Switch to "Threat Detection & Response" tab
2. Show threat correlation timeline
3. **Highlight**: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detected
4. Walk through attack timeline:
   - Initial compromise (suspicious login)
   - Lateral movement (network reconnaissance)
   - Code manipulation (malicious changes)
   - Data exfiltration (25MB transferred)

**Key SQL Demo**:
```sql
-- Multi-source threat correlation
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 'NETWORK_THREAT' as event_type, n.timestamp, n.source_ip
    FROM network_logs n JOIN threat_intelligence t ON n.dest_ip = t.ioc_value
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'USER_ANOMALY', u.timestamp, u.username  
    FROM user_logs u WHERE array_size(u.risk_factors) > 2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'CODE_THREAT', g.timestamp, g.username
    FROM github_logs g WHERE g.lines_added > 1000
) ORDER BY timestamp;
```

**Business Impact**:
- "Complex correlation across 4 data sources in seconds"
- "Would take hours manually - we did it in real-time"
- "Prevented full supply chain compromise"

#### ⚠️ **Use Case 3: AI Vulnerability Prioritization (5 minutes)**

**Business Context**: Intelligent patch prioritization using business context

**Demo Steps**:
1. Navigate to "Vulnerability Prioritization" tab
2. Show CVSS vs AI Risk Score comparison
3. **Focus on**: CVE-2023-46604 (Apache ActiveMQ)
   - CVSS: 10.0 → AI Risk: 10.50
   - Production system + restricted data + active exploitation
4. Show automated patch recommendations

**Key Business Message**:
- "Traditional CVSS scoring misses business context"
- "Our AI considers asset criticality, data classification, threat intelligence"
- "Reduced vulnerability backlog by 70%"

#### 📋 **Use Case 4: Automated GRC & Compliance (4 minutes)**

**Business Context**: CIS Control 16 - Account Monitoring and Control

**Demo Steps**:
1. Switch to "GRC & Compliance" tab
2. Show real-time violations: Alex Turner still accessing AWS 3 days after termination
3. **Highlight**: Automated evidence collection
4. Show compliance score improvement: 60% → 73% → targeting 95%

**Key SQL Demo**:
```sql
-- Automated compliance monitoring
SELECT 
    te.username,
    te.termination_date,
    ac.resource,
    DATEDIFF(day, te.termination_date, ac.timestamp) as days_overdue,
    CASE WHEN days_overdue > 1 THEN 'CRITICAL' ELSE 'HIGH' END as severity
FROM terminated_employees te
JOIN access_logs ac ON te.username = ac.username
WHERE ac.timestamp > te.termination_date;
```

**Business Impact**:
- "Automated compliance monitoring saves 40 hours/week"
- "Real-time violation detection prevents audit findings"
- "Audit prep time reduced from weeks to hours"

#### 🤖 **Use Case 5: AI Alert Triage with Cortex (4 minutes)**

**Business Context**: Intelligent alert classification and prioritization

**Demo Steps**:
1. Open "AI Alert Triage" tab
2. Show AI-enhanced alerts with extracted entities
3. **Demonstrate**: Cortex AI functions
4. Show investigation playbooks auto-generated

**Key Cortex Demo**:
```sql
-- Snowflake Cortex LLM functions
SELECT 
    alert_id,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(description) as ai_summary,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(description) as urgency,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EXTRACT_ANSWER(
        description, 
        'What IP addresses are mentioned?'
    ) as extracted_ips
FROM security_alerts;
```

**Business Impact**:
- "Triage time: 12 minutes → 30 seconds"
