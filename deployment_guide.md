# üõ°Ô∏è Snowflake Cybersecurity AI/ML Demo - Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN privileges
- Streamlit in Snowflake enabled
- Python packages: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `numpy`

### Step 1: Database Setup
Execute the SQL scripts in order:

```sql
-- 1. Create schema and tables
@01_cybersecurity_schema.sql

-- 2. Generate enhanced sample data (500+ users, 180+ days, seasonality)
@02_sample_data_generation.sql

-- 3. Create Native ML models and placeholder Snowpark ML views
@03_ai_ml_models.sql

-- 4. Deploy real Snowpark ML models and UDFs
@04_snowpark_ml_deployment.sql
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important ML Model Notes:**
- Native ML models require **sufficient training data** (90+ days recommended)
- Models will train automatically when first queried
- Allow **5-10 minutes** for initial model training and deployment
- **Real Snowpark ML models** require Python model training and deployment

### Step 2: Train and Deploy Real ML Models with Model Registry

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+ environment with ML packages: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- Snowflake packages: `snowflake-snowpark-python`, `snowflake-ml-python`
- **Snowflake Model Registry** access (included with Snowflake Notebooks)

**Option A: Snowflake Notebooks (Recommended) ‚ú®**
1. **Import notebook into Snowflake Notebooks**:
   - Upload `notebooks/Cybersecurity_ML_Demo_Companion.ipynb` to Snowflake Notebooks
   - Session is automatically configured - no connection parameters needed!
   - Required packages including `snowflake-ml-python` are pre-installed
   
2. **Run all cells** to train and register models in Model Registry
3. **Enterprise benefits**: Version control, metadata management, automated UDF deployment

**Option B: Local Development (Optional)**
For local development outside Snowflake Notebooks:
1. **Set up local Python environment**:
   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Modify notebook connection**:
   - Uncomment the manual connection section in the notebook
   - Add your Snowflake credentials
   - Run notebook locally with Jupyter (`Cybersecurity_ML_Demo_Companion.ipynb`)

3. **Verify Model Registry deployment**:
   ```sql
   -- Check Model Registry models
   SHOW MODELS IN MODEL REGISTRY;
   
   -- Test deployed UDFs
   SELECT CYBERSECURITY_ISOLATION_FOREST_PREDICT(14.5, 2.1, 3, 2, 0.1, 0.2) as anomaly_score;
   
   -- Check ML model performance
   SELECT * FROM ML_DEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION;
   SELECT * FROM ML_MODEL_PERFORMANCE;
   
   -- Test real ML models
   SELECT * FROM SNOWPARK_ML_USER_CLUSTERS LIMIT 10;
   SELECT * FROM ML_MODEL_COMPARISON LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Step 3: Deploy Streamlit App
1. Navigate to Snowflake UI ‚Üí Streamlit
2. Create new Streamlit app
3. Upload `streamlit_cybersecurity_demo.py`
4. Set database context to `CYBERSECURITY_DEMO.SECURITY_AI`
